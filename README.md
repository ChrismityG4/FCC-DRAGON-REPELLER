#  DRAGON REPELLER - JAVASCRIPT ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURE

WOW!  What a difficult learning curve.  For such a simple RPG, I was surprised by the level of intricacy of this coding experience.  This was my first try at coding with the JS language.

After repetition with different lines of code, It slowly started to make sense.  I would say that after completion  40% of the code I can understand and was able to follow the learning instruction of this build with out any stress.

The other 60% however was frustrating at times and it felt like I was trying to learn Chinese.  I’m sure after re-reading the code with fresh eyes will bring more clarity.

I am unfazed and can’t wait to start the next build on the FCC Course.  I’m hopeful that It will get easier and I will take up this language more efficiently as I progress.

Thanks for reading,

Chris Smith
